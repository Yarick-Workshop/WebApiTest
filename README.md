</p>

This project was developed as  a test task. But I found that it might be a good 
template for somebody's WebAPI application.

‚ö†Ô∏è **In case of any questions** ‚Äì do not hesitate to contact the author in Telegram group ([see below](#contact-me)) and ask.

## Description
A simple WebAPI application for searching all intersected rectangles from DB. There is also a WEB method to initialize the DB wit randomly generated rectangles. All the Business Logic is covered with tests.

**Stack of technologies:** EF Core, .NET 8.0, sqlite, C#, MSTest

List of projects:
 - **Common** - common DTOs and interfaces;
